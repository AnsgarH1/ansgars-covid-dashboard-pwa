I wanted an easy way to get the current covid-cases in my county per 100k, but all Dashboards are unnessecary convoluted and either slow in mobile perfomance or covered with ads, so I built one myself.

The Project is also an excuse to learn Typescript and built a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) with React.

## Built with:

- [React.js](reactjs.org)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [API von der Nationalen Plattform f√ºr geographische Daten](https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/)
- hosted on [Netlify](netlify.com) with Continuouse Deployment from Github

## Live-Version

### covid-dash.hoyer-it.de

The layout is optimized for mobile use, don't expect it to look good on desktop.
